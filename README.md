# Hive Game Engine
A game engine for the board game Hive made with Rust.

## Hive
Hive is a bug-themed tabletop game, designed by John Yianni and published in 2001 by Gen42 Games. The object of Hive is to capture the opponent's queen bee by completely surrounding it, while avoiding the capture of one's own queen ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game))).

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a reliable game engine using [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org). The project focus on stability and compatibility with [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/) to provide a way to integrate the Hive Engine into a web application.
